						<td>DMR</td>
						<td class="content">The M395 DMR is a gas-operated magazine-fed marksman rifle
                         that maintains a smart-linked, telescopic, rail-mounted sight for scout personnel.
                          This rifle favors mid-range to long-range combat, offering impressive stopping power.
                           Premier marksman rifle of the <span class="title">UNSC</span>, offering impressive 
                           single-fire accuracy at reasonably
                      long distances. </td>

					<tr>
						<td>Battle Rifle</td>
						<td class="content">Utilizes precise, three-round burst functionality, 
							making it a formidable mid-range, semi-automatic weapon
							. Five shots will take down an enemy without an over-shield. </td>

					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Sniper Rifle</td>
						<td class="content">The SRS99-S5 AM is a gas-operated, magazine-fed, semi-automatic 
							sniper rifle with exceptional accuracy and the ability to simultaneously 
							breach both energy-shielding and high-density armor, making immediate kills 
							nearly effortless when this weapon is properly utilized. </td>

						<td>Assault Rifle</td>
						<td class="content">Standard fully automatic firearm of all <span class="title">UNSC</span> branches,
					  effective at both close-range and mid-range combat. </td>

					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Rocket Launcher</td>
						<td class="content">The Rocket Launcher, or the M41 SSR MAV/AW, is a portable, twin-tube, 
							shoulder-fired rocket launcher, capable of firing two 102mm rockets with 
							incredibly destructive potency. It is easily one of the most pervasive 
							explosive weapons within the <span class="title">UNSC</span>'s arsenal, largely due to its
							transportability and firepower. Devastating from close-range to mid-range, 
					  capable of tracking airborne vehicles after locking onto them. </td>

					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Magnum</td>
     <td class="content"><span class="title">UNSC</span>'s personal sidearm of choice due to its excellence at
      close-range to mid-range engagements. In halo 4, the magnum takes more of a
      side-arm role as the user becomes faster and the weapon does less damage then 
      other semi automatic weapons like the LightRifle or DMR. The most notable change 
      is the ability to carry the flag in CTF games while wielding a Magnum at the same time. </td>

					<tr>
						<td>Shotgun</td>
     <td class="content">Dominant close-quarters weapon specializing in boarding actions,
      breach maneuvers, and urban operations. at short range, this weapon also devastates
      shielded targets due to it's devastating stopping power.</td>
     <td class="pic"><a href="http://www.ign.com/wikis/halo-4/Shotgun" target="_blank">
     <img src="images/shotgun.jpg" alt="Shotgun"/></a></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Rail Gun</td>
     <td class="content">Powerful linear accelerator that fires explosive rounds at tremendous speed to
      efficiently eliminate targets. One shot, that it is accurate, will kill most enemy 
      tagets in one shot. The railgun fires similar to the Spartan Laser, as it has a charge 
      time before it can be fired. </td>

     <img src="images/railgun.png" alt="Rail Gun"/></a></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Spartan Laser</td>
     <td class="content">The Spartan Laser is a man-portable, shoulder mounted charged 
      weapon which uses battery cells to fire a powerful red laser, but takes approximately
      3 seconds to fire. It is mainly used as an anti-vehicle weapon, and excells at taking
      down the lightly armoured vehicles such as warthogs and ghosts. It can be difficult to
      kill spartan or elite targets with this weapon due to it's visual red targeting laser
      or its charge-up sound, but it has no recoil and is perfectly aimed at any distance. 
      The spartan laser can immediately hit what it is pointed at, with great lethality, as
      the image above shows, it makes short work of vehicles like banshees. Formidable nonlinear
      coherent light rifle that is highly proficient at destroying vehicles over impressively
      long distances. </td>

						<td>Sticky Detonator</td>
     <td class="content">Single-hand, short-range explosives launcher which can detonate remotely and
      at the operator's discretion. First shot fires the sticky projectile, which attaches to any surface
      or enemy it hits, and second shot detonates the sticky.  There is a delay before the sticky can be
      detonated. </td>
