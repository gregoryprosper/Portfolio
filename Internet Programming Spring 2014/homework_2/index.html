  <td>DMR</td>
  <td class="content">The M395 DMR is a gas-operated magazine-fed marksman rifle
  that maintains a smart-linked, telescopic, rail-mounted sight for scout personnel.
  This rifle favors mid-range to long-range combat, offering impressive stopping power.
  Premier marksman rifle of the <span class="title">UNSC</span>, offering impressive 
  single-fire accuracy at reasonably
  long distances. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Battle Rifle</td>
  <td class="content">Utilizes precise, three-round burst functionality, 
  making it a formidable mid-range, semi-automatic weapon
  . Five shots will take down an enemy without an over-shield. </td>

  <td>Sniper Rifle</td>
  <td class="content">The SRS99-S5 AM is a gas-operated, magazine-fed, semi-automatic 
  sniper rifle with exceptional accuracy and the ability to simultaneously 
  breach both energy-shielding and high-density armor, making immediate kills 
  nearly effortless when this weapon is properly utilized. </td>

  <tr>
  <td>Rocket Launcher</td>
  <td class="content">The Rocket Launcher, or the M41 SSR MAV/AW, is a portable, twin-tube, 
  shoulder-fired rocket launcher, capable of firing two 102mm rockets with 
  incredibly destructive potency. It is easily one of the most pervasive 
  explosive weapons within the <span class="title">UNSC</span>'s arsenal, largely due to its
  transportability and firepower. Devastating from close-range to mid-range, 
  capable of tracking airborne vehicles after locking onto them. </td>

  <tr>
  <td>Magnum</td>
  <td class="content"><span class="title">UNSC</span>'s personal sidearm of choice due to its excellence at
  close-range to mid-range engagements. In halo 4, the magnum takes more of a
  side-arm role as the user becomes faster and the weapon does less damage then 
  other semi automatic weapons like the LightRifle or DMR. The most notable change 
  is the ability to carry the flag in CTF games while wielding a Magnum at the same time. </td>

  <tr>
  <td>Shotgun</td>
  <td class="content">Dominant close-quarters weapon specializing in boarding actions,
  breach maneuvers, and urban operations. at short range, this weapon also devastates
  shielded targets due to it's devastating stopping power.</td>
  <td class="pic"><a href="http://www.ign.com/wikis/halo-4/Shotgun" target="_blank">
  <img src="images/shotgun.jpg" alt="Shotgun"/></a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Rail Gun</td>
  <td class="content">Powerful linear accelerator that fires explosive rounds at tremendous speed to
  efficiently eliminate targets. One shot, that it is accurate, will kill most enemy 
  tagets in one shot. The railgun fires similar to the Spartan Laser, as it has a charge 
  time before it can be fired. </td>

  <img src="images/railgun.png" alt="Rail Gun"/></a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Spartan Laser</td>
  <td class="content">The Spartan Laser is a man-portable, shoulder mounted charged 
  weapon which uses battery cells to fire a powerful red laser, but takes approximately
  3 seconds to fire. It is mainly used as an anti-vehicle weapon, and excells at taking
  down the lightly armoured vehicles such as warthogs and ghosts. It can be difficult to
  kill spartan or elite targets with this weapon due to it's visual red targeting laser
  or its charge-up sound, but it has no recoil and is perfectly aimed at any distance. 
  The spartan laser can immediately hit what it is pointed at, with great lethality, as
  the image above shows, it makes short work of vehicles like banshees. Formidable nonlinear
  coherent light rifle that is highly proficient at destroying vehicles over impressively
  long distances. </td>

  <tr>
  <td>Sticky Detonator</td>
  <td class="content">Single-hand, short-range explosives launcher which can detonate remotely and
  at the operator's discretion. First shot fires the sticky projectile, which attaches to any surface
  or enemy it hits, and second shot detonates the sticky.  There is a delay before the sticky can be
  detonated. </td>

  <td class="content">Forerunner particle dilator used for both its precision at
   mid-range and its burst functionality when up close. It is designed as a close-range 
   precision weapon. It operates by devastating organic matter. The boltshot was first 
   used at the end of the first century of the Foreunner-Flood war.</td>

  <td class="content">The Anti-Material Z-390 High-Explosive Munitions Rifle fires several 
  streams of explosive particles along multiple paths that detonate and spread on impact. 
  Mixing trails of a Rocket Launcher, Shotgun and Flamethrower, it is a highly destructive weapon. 
  Only Promethean Knight Commanders can wield this weapon.</td>

  shields and health.</td>

  <td>Gravity Hammer</td>
  <td class="content">The Type-2 Energy Weapon/Hammer (or T2 EW/H) is more commonly identified as 
  the Gravity Hammer. This weapon consists of a haft, head, and blade. A field generator, which is 
  located in the head, emits a kinetic pulse (~4.5 meters). The exact mechanism by which it functions 
  is currently under investigation. It is unknown why this weapon has been brought back due to there 
  being no Brutes. Most probable reason is for Grifball, although it also appears in War Games matches. </td>
