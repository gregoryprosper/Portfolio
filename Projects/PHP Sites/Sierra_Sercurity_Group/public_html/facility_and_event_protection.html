                    <p>At Sierra Security, there isn't an event too small or a facility too large. Our project managers and officers 
                        possess extensive experience in planning and providing short-term and long-term security services for small to 
                        mid-size events like: concerts, festivals, parties, etc as well as facilities like: hospitals, hotels, malls, 
                        neighborhoods, car dealerships, storefronts, etc. Our management team will collaborate with you to develop a 
                        highly affordable security scheme that molds to your needs. Our services included the provision of armed &

                    <h1>Sierra Officers (agents, guards)</h1>
                    <p><b>Experienced</b> - ​​We understand your need to mitigate risk while facilitating a safe and serene atmosphere for your customers. 
                        Our event and facility security officers are trained to display an authoritative, non-aggressive posture unless additional 
                        intervention is absolutely necessary. Our officers are trained and certified in the latest non-violent crisis intervention 
                        techniques (NVCI) to subdue anyone who is posing a serious threat to others in the safest way possible. All Sierra officers 
                        are trained first responders and certified in C.P.R and the use of an A.E.D. Nearly all of our officers have elite military 
                        or law enforcement experience and have been proven in the most stressful situations imaginable.</p>
                    <p><b>Attentive</b> - Vigilance is key. Our officers are trained and proven in the art of situational awareness to identify, prevent, 
                        and deter any behavior before evolving into a major issue. Fights, burglary, vandalism, terrorism, and fires may be prevented 
                        with trained eyes working for you.</p>
